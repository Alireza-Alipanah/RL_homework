# RL_homework

In this HW, Q-learning is used to train an agent that acts in two different environments:
<ol>
<li>
In the first question we train the agent in the Frozen lake environment, In this enviroment the actions are non deterministic and states are discrete.
</li>
<li>
In the second question we train the agein in the Mountain car environment where actions are deterministic and states are continuous. We tackle this problem by first discretizing the states.
</li>
</ol>
Videos of agent's performance before and after the training are included in this repo.
